FLake was developed by Dmitrii Mironov and collaborators at the German Weather Service (DWD). The Python physics source retains the original code-owner notices for DWD, Dmitrii Mironov and Ulrich Schaettler, together with the original section histories and references. The module name has been simplified; the physics expressions remain those of the supplied Python implementation.

The notebook, configuration interface, examples and plotting workflow form the accompanying Python guide. They do not imply endorsement by DWD. Original third-party notices are preserved. No blanket license is assigned to inherited material; confirm upstream reuse terms before the public repository release.

The example lake properties and optical parameters follow the Minnesota companion study. Meteorological origin: NEX-GDDP-CMIP6, GFDL-ESM4 historical and SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. Historical coverage is 1995–2014; future coverage is 2015–2040. Example snow-retention assignments are specific to the Minnesota regional application.
